## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer financial transaction data to understand account
usage patterns, transaction behavior, and potential financial risk indicators.

The analysis applies Python-based data processing and statistical techniques to uncover
irregular activity, balance volatility, and customer segments that may require closer monitoring
or strategic intervention.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Analyze customer transaction behavior across different account types  
- Identify patterns associated with financial risk and balance instability  
- Segment customers based on activity level and balance trends  
- Detect anomalies and irregular transaction behavior  
- Support data-driven risk assessment and decision-making  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing  
- Risk Segmentation & Anomaly Detection  
- Data Visualization

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes transactional summaries of customer accounts, such as:
- Transaction amounts and types (credit/debit)
- Account types and balances
- Customer risk scores and tenure
- Time-based transaction details

## 🔍 Analytical Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Cleaned and standardized financial fields  
- Converted transaction values to numerical format  
- Validated date formats and transaction categories  

### 2️⃣ Transaction & Behavior Analysis
- Analyzed monthly and yearly credit/debit trends  
- Identified top and bottom performing accounts  
- Flagged inactive or dormant accounts  

### 3️⃣ Customer Segmentation
- Grouped customers by activity level and balance patterns  
- Built profiles for high-risk and low-balance accounts  

### 4️⃣ Financial Risk Identification
- Measured balance volatility using statistical metrics  
- Applied anomaly detection techniques to identify irregular behavior  
- Flagged accounts with frequent large withdrawals or overdraft patterns  

### 5️⃣ Statistical Testing
- Conducted hypothesis testing to compare balance stability across segments  
- Evaluated relationships between transaction volume and account balance  

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- High transaction frequency does not always correlate with higher balance stability  
- Certain customer segments exhibited higher balance volatility and risk patterns  
- Statistical analysis helped differentiate normal behavior from anomalous activity
